List of supported HP-GL commands:         Date: 93/09/02
=================================

hp2xx emulates a subset of the Hewlett-Packard 7550A plotter.
The following manual was used as reference for command definitions:

     [1] "HP 7550A Interfacing and Programming Manual"



Not all commands are supported. Among the non-supported commands
are those which do not really apply to a software emulator, like:

   o commands affecting the communication between plotter and host computer,

   o commands for changing the behaviour of a real plotter, like
     plotting speed etc.,

   o commands for the control of plotter memory allocation,

   o commands causing various plotter outputs.


Other non-supported commands would be desirable, but were left out
due to their inherent complexity (or just because nobody pushed me, :-) ).
Among those are:

   o commands for font (character set) management.
       Since there is only one font built into hp2xx, there is
       no point in providing font switching etc.

   o windowing/clipping and rotation

   o polygon and box filling commands


The remainder of this file tabulates all HP-GL commands listed on
pages 1-2 to 1-4 in [1] and marks them as either

      not applicable       (.),
      ignored              (-), or
      supported            (+)

  I use the label "supported" when I think the command is fully supported
only in the context of the already implemented commands. In general,
you should have absolutely no problem with this class of commands.

  Though there still are unsupported commands, this does not mean that
you might have trouble using hp2xx. Nowadays, most HP-GL files are
machine-generated, e.g. by CAD or DTP programs. These tend to make use
of just a simple subset of HP-GL. To my experience, chances are high
that hp2xx will give you the picture you want!
