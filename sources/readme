makefile     A symbolic link to ../makes/generic.mak

bresnham.c   Implementation of Bresenham algorithm (for line rasterization)
chardraw.c   Code for drawing ASCII characters
getopt.c     from GNU getopt, slightly modified -- don't re-distribute!
getopt1.c    from GNU getopt -- don't re-distribute, use original!
hp2xx.c      High-level routines for hp2xx
hpgl.c       HP-GL parser etc.
no_prev.c    A dummy previewer
picbuf.c     Code for raster ops (vector-to-internal-bitmap)
to_amiga.c   AMIGA previewer
to_atari.c   ATARI previewer
to_dj_gr.c   DOS full-screen (S)VGA previewer, based on DJ Delorie's gr lib
to_eps.c     Output converter for EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)
to_ilbm.c    AMIGA only: IFF-InterLeave BitMap converter
to_img.c     Output converter for IMF (DR's Image format)
to_mf.c      Output converter for Metafont sources and related vector formats
to_os2.c     OS/2 full-screen previewer (only b/w); uses to_vga.c in DOS mode
to_pac.c     Output converter for ATARI PAC format (unsupported)
to_pbm.c     Output converter for PBM (Portable BitMap) format
to_pcl.c     Output converter for HP PLC Level 3 (and some Deskjet extras)
to_pcx.c     Output converter for Paintbrush PCX format (color not working yet!)
to_pic.c     Output converter for ATARI PIC format (unsupported)
to_pm.c      OS/2 PM previewer (unsupported -- stderr output is lost yet)
to_rgip.c    Output converter for Uniplex RGIP vector format
to_sunvw.c   SunView previewer (unsupported -- outdated)
to_uis.c     VAX-VMS UIS previewer
to_vga.c     DOS full-screen VGA previewer
to_x11.c     X11 previewer

bresnham.h   Contains a basic struct -- needed by almost all C sources
chardraw.h   Header for character drawing.
charset0.h   Definition of built-in font / character set 0
getopt.h     from GNU getopt -- don't re-distribute, use original!
hp2xx.h      Central to almost all C sources
iff.h        AMIGA only: for IFF-InterLeave BitMap converter
ilbm.h       AMIGA only: for IFF-InterLeave BitMap converter
x11.h        Some X11 extras


NOTE about unsupported formats:
------------------------------

  o  to_dj_gr.c  works fine on 386 and 486 CPUs, but I'd rather replace it
                 by code both applicable to DOS and OS/2, and that will be
                 emx.

  o  to_pm.c     is my first OS/2 PM project. It seems to work nicely, with
                 the exception that I don't know how to re-direct hp2xx's
                 diag output (to stderr or log file) into a second window
                 WITHOUT significant changes in the sources.

                 If you know a simple way -- please tell me
                 (I'm aware of pmprtf -- this come close but won't do it).

  o  to_pic.c    The PIC format was mainly used by ATARI programs like
                 Signum. I consider it outdated. Try to work with IMG.

  o  to_pac.c    Similar to PIC (compressed version of PIC), used e. g.
                 by STaD.



For installation, get a suitable makefile from ../makes and follow
intructions in ../makes/README.

For details of operation, see ../doc/hp2xxinf.tex (hp2xx.texinfo).

Optionally test hp2xx with HP-GL files provided in ../hp-tests.
E. g., run

            % hp2xx -h100 -w100 ../hp-tests/ascii.hp

(This should result in a graphical display of the available
 character set 0.)


Enjoy!
